            By using the Platform, you agree to resolve any disputes or claims
            arising out of or in connection with these Terms, the Platform, or
            your participation in sweepstakes through binding arbitration
            instead of in a court of law. This arbitration agreement is governed
            by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 et seq., and will
            apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h3>10.3. Class Action Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to resolve disputes with Golden Ticket on an individual
            basis. You waive any right to participate in class actions, class
            arbitrations, or representative actions with respect to any claims
            covered by this arbitration agreement.
          </p>

          <h3>10.4. Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>

              proprietary content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Filing a claim in small claims court if the dispute falls within

            Golden Ticket will cover all administrative fees and arbitrator fees
            for arbitration initiated by you, except where the arbitrator

            party will bear its own legal costs, including attorney's fees,
            unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or
            your use of the Platform must be filed within one (1) year from the
            date the claim arose. Failure to file within this timeframe
            constitutes a waiver of the claim.
          </p>

          <h3>10.8. Severability of Arbitration Clause</h3>
          <p>
            If any portion of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable,
            the remainder of the agreement will remain in full force and effect,
            except that there will be no class or representative arbitration.
          </p>
