          </p>

          <h2>1. Our Commitment to Responsible Social Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Golden Ticket is designed to provide entertainment and social
            interaction in a safe, secure, and lawful environment. To achieve
            this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We ensure all games and sweepstakes comply with applicable U.S.
              laws and regulations, including state and federal sweepstakes
              laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              We provide tools and resources to help players manage their time
              and spending on the platform.

            <li>
              We actively work to prevent fraud, abuse, and misuse of our
              platform.
            </li>
